## Current Status

### **Basic knowledge on OpenCore is needed!**

* Based on OpenCore Official Release 0.5.3

* Native(?) NVRAM works.

* Soundcard with injected Layout-ID 21 works well.

* ~~CFG Lock cannot be unlocked in Huawei's fxxking BIOS. However everything just works. I'm not able to modify the confusing InsydeH2O BIOS now.~~
    The way to modify BIOS is found, I'll update later to explain how to unlock CFG and change DVMT.

* Replaced stock Intel Wireless 8265AC with BCM94360CS2 and an adapter. Using [AirportBrcmFixup](https://github.com/acidanthera/AirportBrcmFixup) with `brcmfx-country=#a`to enable all WiFi channels.

* Use [one-key-cpufriend](https://github.com/stevezhengshiqi/one-key-cpufriend) to gain a better CPU power management.

* DGPU nVidia MX150 is disabled by SSDT-DDGPU.

* **Use `USBInjectall.kext` to avoid potential USB map differences. However, customizing your own `USBports.kext` by [Hackintool](http://headsoft.com.au/download/mac/Hackintool.zip) is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. You can read the help document inside for more details.**


* This EFI may also works on Magicbook 14 Kabylake-R. ( Just I guess, it may need some minor modifications)

* You may need to use your own System-UUID when you need dual boot with Windows 10.  

* Minor bugs: 
    1. ~~Screen backlight requires a second-open to turn on after closing lid.~~    
    Now fixed by `SSDT-LID-Wake-After-Sleep` ,thanks to [hjmmc](https://github.com/hjmmc) : [Honor-Magicbook](https://github.com/hjmmc/Honor-Magicbook) <br>   
    I added a `_OSI`  determination to meet the needs of dual boot with Windows/Linux by OpenCore though it's not recommended.  

    2. Trackpad doesn't work and a USB mouse is needed when installing.

## TODOs

* Chinese version of this document(简体中文文档会有的，不过现在用翻译器也能看，I'm just lazy)

* Improvements on Hibernation.

* BIOS unlock tutorial.

* ~~Windows 10 startup item in OpenCore (I think using boot menu is a better choice)~~  <br>

    Do NOT use OpenCore to boot windows. Using Boot Menu is recommended.
